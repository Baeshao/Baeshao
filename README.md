- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoyed creating meaningful and fun things with my hands for others. When I was a child, I studied art for 5 years beacause I wanted to design things. Even though that dream was put to stop, now I still want to develop solutions for people in need as a bioscience researcher.
